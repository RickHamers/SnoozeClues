  <!---------------------------------------------------- Hours of sleep ---------------------------------------------------->
  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.hours >= 7">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You are getting the recommended amount of hours of sleep!</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      You answered that you sleep more than 7 hours on average, which is good! The recommended hours of sleep for the
      average person is between 7 and 9 hours of sleep.

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Keep it up, you are doing well!</b>
    </mat-card-content>

  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.hours <= 6">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You are getting less than the recommended hours of sleep.</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      You answered that you sleep 6 hours or less on average, which isn't quite enough! The recommended hours of sleep for the
      average person is between 7 and 9 hours of sleep.
      <br>
      <br>
      Try to fall asleep and wake up at the same hours of the day and night. Keeping a consistent schedule will help regulate
      your sleep/wake cycle, making it easier for your body to respond accordingly to the hours of the day.

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>It is recommended to keep a consistent sleep/wake schedule, this will improve the amount of hours of sleep!</b>

  <!---------------------------------------------------- Tiredness ---------------------------------------------------->
  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.tired <= 3">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You feel energized and alert during the day!</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      You answered that you don't feel very tired during the day, at least not more than average. This is a good sign,
      because it means you are going to bed and waking up at the correct moments with regards to your REM-sleep cycles.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you want to make sure you can actively keep this up, you might be interested in using a tool like <a
      href="sleepyti.me">sleepytime</a>, which will help you with keeping a healthy sleep/wake schedule.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Keep it up, you are doing well!</b>
    </mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>

  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.tired > 3">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You feel tired and groggy during the day.</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      You answered that you feel above average levels of tiredness during the day. This might be a sign that you are
      going to bed and waking up at times that don't work well with the amount of REM-sleep cycles you are getting.
      <br>
      <br>
      You go through several sleep cycles during the night. If you wake up in the middle of one of these sleep cycles,
      you will wake up feeling very groggy and sleeping, almost as if you didn't sleep at all. A tool like
      <a href="https://sleepyti.me/" target="_blank">sleepytime</a> can help you choose better times to go to bed or wake up, which will
      make sure you wake before or after a complete cycle. This will make you feel much more energized and ready
      to start the day!
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>It is recommended to look into the times you wake up and go to bed. Try using a tool like

  <!---------------------------------------------------- PhoneUsed ---------------------------------------------------->
  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.phoneUsed == 1">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You are using your phone before within 30 minutes of going to bed.</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      You answered that you use your phone within 30 minutes of going to bed. The screen on your cell phone emits
      blue light, which restrains the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls your sleep-wake cycle. This
      makes it more difficult to fall asleep and wake up the next day.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, using your phone will increase your alertness, because your brain is processing new information.
      Even if you are not viewing upsetting content, you are keeping your mind engaged and are tricking it into thinking
      it needs to stay awake.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Therefore, it is recommended that you stop using your phone before bed. It will help you sleep!</b>
    </mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>

  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.phoneUsed == 0">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You are doing well by not using your phone before bed!</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      If you find yourself craving something to do before bed, try and grab a book to read or something similar.
      This will make sure you can keep up your good habits!

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Keep it up, you are doing well!</b>
    </mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>

  <!---------------------------------------------------- PhoneReach ---------------------------------------------------->
  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.phoneReach == 1">
    <mat-card-subtitle>Your phone is within arm's reach when you are in bed</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      Having your phone within arm's reach when you are in bed will make it more difficult for you to ignore it. Using
      your phone will prevent you from getting a good night's rest, because the flow of new information and the blue light
      emitted by your phone's screen will keep you awake during the night.
      <br>
      <br>
      It is recommended to put your phone somewhere you can't reach during the night. If you are afraid to miss an important
      call, change the settings of your phone to only ring when someone important calls. At that point you can keep your
      phone in the same room, but it should still out of reach when you are in bed. This will help you fall asleep much more quickly!

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>It is recommended that you put your phone out of reach when you're in bed, so as to not entice you to use it before trying to sleep.</b>
    </mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>

  <mat-card *ngIf="questionaire.phoneReach == 0">
    <mat-card-subtitle>You are doing well by having your phone out of the way when you're in bed!</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
      Having your phone within reach whilst in bed will entice you to use it, which in turn will keep you from falling asleep.
      Therefore it is very good that you already made sure it is out of reach when you're in bed!
      <br>
      <br>
      If you ever find it difficult to let go of your phone for the night, or if you are afraid to miss a call, you can
      change the settings of the phone to ring only when someone you specified calls. At that point you can safely put
      it away, and perhaps distract yourself by grabbing a book to read before bed.

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>You are doing well, keep it up!</b>
